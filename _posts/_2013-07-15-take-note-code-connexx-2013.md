title: Take Note: Code Connexx 2013
---

No matter where you come from or what your background may be, you take notes.  There is no escaping them.  Whether you write them down, record them digitally, or just store them mentally, you are taking notes.

As a developer taking notes is a soft skill that probably doesn't even register on your radar, you would rather spend 3 days learning a new compiler than spend 15 minutes improving your note-taking, and that's cool, but the pay-off for efficient notes can be huge, and an investment well worth your time.

On the most simple level, efficient notes will allow you to confidently forget something you've learnt or must remember, safe in the knowledge that you will be able to find that information again in your notes at a moments notice, freeing up your brain for more pressing tasks, such as learning new compilers, or solving complex problems in your new app.

##Types of Notes

All forms of note-taking can be distilled down to three distinct types:

* Information Retention
* Progress Tracking
* Idea Exploration
