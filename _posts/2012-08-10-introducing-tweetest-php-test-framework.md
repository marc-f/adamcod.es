A few weeks ago I stumbled upon the [Twitto](http://twitto.org/) 'Web Framework in a Tweet' by [Fabien Potencier](http://fabien.potencier.org/), creator of the Symphony Framework.

I was sure I had come across it before, as well as the [140 Character Web-App Challenge](http://f055.net/article/the-140-character-webapp-challenge/) that has inspired it, but not paid much attention to either.  What made a difference this time, however, was that earlier that day I had written a tiny test function for a disposable proof of concept that didn't warrant a full unit testing framework.  I opened up my file from earlier that day, and after a few tweaks, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/sixdaysad/status/223484283254349824) the result.

Since then (mostly for fun) I decided to see if I could replicate all of the assertions from PHPUnit with my tiny test function and nothing more.  It turns out, [you can](http://adambrett.github.com/tweetest), so I gave tweetest a name, created a [GitHub repo](http://github.com/adambrett/tweetest) and even a [website](http://adambrett.github.com/tweetest) with some documentation to show others what could be done.
