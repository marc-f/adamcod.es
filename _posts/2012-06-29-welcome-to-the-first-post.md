Hello, this is a test.

Ever since I got my first low spec VPS I've been interested in finding more efficient ways of using those resources.  I've looked at all sorts of caching and server tweaks aimed as consuming less resources and had some successes, and quite a lot of failures, so when I first came across the jekyll blogging engine a few years ago _it just made sense_.

Ever since then I've wanted to try using it, but for one reason or another never got around to it.  Now that's going to change, this is my first foray into blogging with jekyll, and I'm going to see how it goes.  Stay tuned.
