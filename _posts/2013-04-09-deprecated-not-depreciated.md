title: There's no <em>i</em> in deprecated
---

Yesterday I had a full day of interviews and one of the candidates said something that bothered me:

In the context of a language feature that is to be removed in a future version, he said that the feature was _depreciated_, when I'm pretty sure he meant _deprecated_.  At the time I let it go, but it turns out, he is not alone in his confusion[^1].

The difference in spelling is subtle, and both words have the same latin root.  However, in terms of computer programming, features are _deprecated_, which in this context is synonymous for _obsolete_ or _superseded_.

To _deprec**i**ate_ has no real context in computer programming, and instead refers to a decrease in value, for example in an asset or currency.

It's an easy mistake to make.
