1) Quicktime is good for quick demos, but the quality isn't up to scratch for a decent recording
2) Don't trying to record the whole session in one go, record it in parts
3) Don't record your whole desktop, just record the window
4) Break it up with some slides, re-enforce what you're doing with text
