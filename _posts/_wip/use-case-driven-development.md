Use-case driven development is an idea I've been playing with for a while, and have had my team at work using for around 6 months now, and it seems to be working well.

##What is Use Case Driven Development?

##What Problem Does it Attempt to Solve?

Use-case driven development attempts to move application code from framework specific formats into a generic and framework agnostic set of classes that can be used in any framework.  The end goal being three-fold:

1. To make migrating between frameworks and major versions less painful
2. To remove duplication, and use the best tool for the job.  E.g. using a micro-framework for our API and a full-stack framework for our full web-app without having to duplicate effort and maintenance
3.

##What Does the Process Involve?

- Having a loose spec
- Breaking it down to individual use-cases
    - Methods for doing this
        - Path Analysis
        - Others?


##A Working Example

- Introduction/Spec
- Path Analysis
- Break Into Separate Use Cases
- Use Case Analysis
- Write Code
- Use In Framework
